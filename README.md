# SIADS-capstone-building-damage-detection-TEAM-GOONERS-
We plan to assess levels/severity of damage for the damaged buildings but with MVP solution we at minimum plan to develop a model that can distinguish between damaged and non damaged buildings. 



proposal and questions we hope to answer or explore? 
Using pre and post disaster satellite imagery of disaster stricken areas, we will assess building damage to aid first responders in selecting/prioritizing relief work in the affected areas. Post disaster relief work in 24-48 hrs if carried out in most affected areas can improve chances of rescuing survivors and minimize human casualties. We hope our classification model can identify most damaged structures in the affected area so that it can be used by the disaster management team to direct resources for relief work.


What ethical challenges or concerns do we expect to encounter in this project? If there are potential concerns, how do we plan to mitigate them?
Our goal is identify damaged structures in the area due natural disaster and aide first responders to identify most impacted areas. Naturally, due to building density of cities, the model might have a bias in identifying mostly the city areas of the region and due to that rural areas (low density) might get neglected by the first responders. We will try to convey our model's prediction bias to the decision makers so that they can make necessary interventions in selecting first response target areas.
